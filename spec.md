Detailed specification of the libraries and technologies used:

1. googleapis: This library is provided by Google and serves as the client library for accessing various Google APIs, including1. the Gmail API. It provides a set of methods and classes to make API requests, handle authentication. In the code, the googleapis library is used to configure the Gmail API client, make requests to retrieve emails and threads, send replies, and modify labels.

2. dotenv: The dotenv library allows you to load environment variables from a .env file into Node.js applications. Environment variables store sensitive information such as API credentials and configuration settings.

3. Node.js: The code is written in JavaScript and runs on the Node.js runtime environment. Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

4. OAuth2: The OAuth2 authentication protocol is used to authenticate the application and authorize it to access the Gmail API on behalf of the user.

5. Gmail API: The Gmail API is a RESTful API provided by Google that allows developers to interact with Gmail and perform various operations such as sending emails, reading emails, managing labels, and more.

6. Base64 Encoding: The createRawMessage function in the code constructs the raw message string for the reply email. It uses Base64 encoding to encode the message before sending it as the raw property in the API request. Base64 encoding is a common method to encode binary data into ASCII characters, which is required when sending email content through the Gmail API.
